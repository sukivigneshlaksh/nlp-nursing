CMS PAP DEVICE CERTIFICATION INTERVIEW
Date: June 18, 2025

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: I need to complete the CMS Certificate of Medical Necessity for your PAP device. Let me gather the required information.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: This is an initial certification, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, this is my first time getting a CPAP machine.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Let me confirm your information. Your name is Robert Williams, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Robert J. Williams.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Your address is 1234 Main Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Phone number is 614-555-0123?
PATIENT: Yes.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Your Medicare number is 1EG4-TE5-MK72?
PATIENT: That sounds right.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Date of birth is March 15, 1965?
PATIENT: Correct, I'm 60 years old.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: You're male, height 5 foot 10 inches, weight 210 pounds?
PATIENT: Yes, that's all correct.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Dr. Peterson is your ordering physician at Sleep Medicine Associates, 567 Medical Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43220, phone 614-555-7890?
PATIENT: Yes, that's my sleep doctor.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Now for the clinical questions. Is this device being ordered for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Yes, that's what Dr. Peterson diagnosed me with.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Your initial face-to-face evaluation with Dr. Peterson was on May 20, 2025?
PATIENT: Yes, that was my first appointment.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Your sleep study was conducted on June 1, 2025?
PATIENT: Yes, I spent the night at the sleep lab.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Was your sleep test conducted in a facility-based lab?
PATIENT: Yes, I went to the Columbus Sleep Center overnight.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Your sleep study showed an AHI of 35 events per hour?
PATIENT: Yes, Dr. Peterson said that was severe sleep apnea.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Do you have documented symptoms like excessive daytime sleepiness, mood issues, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I have high blood pressure and I'm constantly tired during the day. I fall asleep at work sometimes.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Since we're ordering a standard CPAP device, not a bilevel, this question doesn't apply to you.
PATIENT: Okay.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: The equipment being ordered is a ResMed AirSense 10 CPAP machine with heated humidifier and full face mask.
PATIENT: That's what Dr. Peterson recommended.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: The estimated length of need is lifetime, which we code as 99 months.
PATIENT: Dr. Peterson said I'll need this permanently.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: The primary diagnosis code is 327.23 for obstructive sleep apnea, with secondary code 401.9 for hypertension.
PATIENT: That matches what Dr. Peterson told me.

MEDICAL ASSISTANT: Dr. Peterson will review and sign this form to certify the medical necessity.
PATIENT: Perfect, when can I get the machine?
