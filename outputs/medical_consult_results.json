Key numerical and qualitative findings (e.g., vital signs and troponin results) are included.\n\n3. **Thorough Service Documentation:**  \n   The extraction of service details—such as time spent, service not being telehealth, and explicit tasks performed—demonstrates completeness and supports billing and compliance needs.\n\n---\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Minor Omission/Generalization:**  \n   Some less prominent details from the transcript, such as exact patient and physician dialogue (e.g., the patient's specific concerns/questions or emotional state, such as \"I'm scared, but I'm glad you caught this\"), are summarized or omitted in the extraction. While not strictly clinical, these can be valuable for holistic or narrative documentation.\n\n2. **Small Metadata Gaps:**  \n   Fields such as \"version_date\" and \"date_of_review\" are set to null, and \"documenting_clinical_info_ehr\" is null.
